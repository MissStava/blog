If the _Principles_ of Agile are the **what**, then the _Practices_ of Extreme Programming are an example of how the **how** can be implemented. XP isn't the only way to implement the Agile principles and values, but parts of it are certainly the most well known.

**Customer Team Member**<br>
The customer (the person who defines and prioritises features) works as closely as possible with the development team.

**User Stories**<br>
The customer jots down enough words on a card to remind everyone of the conversation that agrees the requirements, and the development team adds a estimate. Nothing more formal than that.

**Short Cycles**<br>
Each iteration produces potentially shippable, working software, that is then demonstrated to the stakeholders.

**Acceptance Tests**<br>
The user story details are captured in the form of acceptance tests specified by the customer, which the developers then create.

**Pair Programming**<br>
Production code is written by a pair of programmers working together at the same workstation.

**Test-Driven Development**<br>
Production code is written to make a failing test pass. This gives the developers a means to check the validity of the system.

**Collective Ownership**<br>
Nobody has more authority over a module or technology than anybody else.

**Continuous Integration**<br>
Developers will merge little and often, several times a day, and ensuring the tests all still pass as part of a merge.

**Sustainable Pace**<br>
A team should run at a steady, moderate pace.

**Open Workspace**<br>
The team sits together, in an open space room, that allows them to communicate easily.

**The Planning Game**<br>
The customer decides how important a feature is, the developers decide how much it will cost to implement. At the begining of an iteration the developers give the customer a budget, and the customer spends it.

**Simple design**<br>
Keep the design as simple and expressive as possible. Find the simplest solution for the story in this iteration, don't add functionality before it's actually needed, and don't allow code to be repeated.

**Refactoring**<br>
Transform the structure of the code without changing the behaviour often, removing code smells, and make sure the tests still pass.

**Metaphor**<br>
The most often overlooked practice, the "metaphor" is a description of the system works that's understood by the whole team. This helps a developer to know the best place to put new functionality, or where to find it, by describing the relationship between elements. It can even help to decide if a new proposed feature is actually a good fit, by trying to describe its place in the metaphor. Ron Jeffries gives the example of a beehive, with worker bees going out to fetch pollen. This could be a metaphor for an agent based information retrieval system.
