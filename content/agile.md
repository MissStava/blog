Having been on the _Agile_ journey for a few years, it can sometimes be easy to drift from the Values and Principles laid down by the **Agile Manifesto**.

As a refresher, the Values are:

+ Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
+ Working software over comprehensive documentation
+ Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
+ Responding to change over following a plan

While it makes sense, that above all what we're trying to achieve as software developers is to add value as best we can, I've found the Values to be quite high level and abstract. The Principles though deliver more concrete guidance:

+ Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
+ Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
+ Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale.
+ Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
+ Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
+ The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
+ Working software is the primary measure of progress.
+ Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
+ Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
+ Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
+ The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams.
+ At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

The point that resonates the most with me is the 5th one. Build projects around motivated people, support them with what they need, then get out of the way. The importance of a self-organising, enabled, motivated, and **empowered** team can't be stressed highly enough. Too often we're shackled by process, battling against legacy or policies that just slow us down.

The principles are powerful indeed, and we as software developers would do well to refresh our minds on them every now and then.
