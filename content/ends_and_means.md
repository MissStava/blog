I've started reading Greenleaf's Servant Leadership recently, as I feel it'll make me a better software developer. I've only got a few pages in, and already read something that really resonated.

The end not justifying the means can be applied to the software development cycle. Perhaps a bug has been found in the production environment and you need to get it fixed as soon as you. Do you fix it quick and dirty? Sure, the production issue goes away, but what kind of state have you left the codebase in, and how much technical debt has that introduced? Instead, you expend a bit more time and effort and put a well thought out tested fix in place. The codebase is all the better for it.

Maybe it doesn't fit for all circumstances, but it's something to keep in mind.
