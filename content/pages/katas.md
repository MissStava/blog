### FizzBuzz
Output a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100, but with the following rules<br>
- If the number is divisible by 3, output "Fizz"<br>
- If the number is divisible by 5, output "Buzz"<br>
- If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz"

### Collatz Conjecture
This is an algorithm that given a positive number will eventually reach 1. Return the number of steps needed for a given number to reach 1. The rules of the algorithm are:<br>
- If the current number is even, divide it by 2<br>
- If the current number is odd, multiply it by 3 and plus 1

### WordWrap
